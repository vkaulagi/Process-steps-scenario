The feature works as a sort of cashback scheme in which I can earn more by eating there more. ", "The screen is mainly how I get to the scheduling of the lightbulbs I have connected to the app along with the simpler 'tap to run' where I can just click it to turn on/off when needed. Getting to the screen is easy, down at the bottom where it says home/scene/etc you start on the \"home\" screen when you open the app. From there I simply clicked on 'scene' and it brings me to this page. From there I'm able to change the different scenes I have enabled or create new ones -- things like turning on the lights every night at a certain time and determining what percentage I want them at (higher for reading, lower for watching television, etc). I can even change the color of the lights which we like to do at night when we watch tv so that it leaves a slight glow (red or really dark blue) and it isn't completely pitch black.", "I am a gambler so this screen is one of the keys to how i do my research. If I want to focus on hockey then I open up the flashscore app. I scroll to the games that are being played today after clicking the hockey button. It has all the different leagues in the world so I would click nhl. Say I am betting on red wings vs devils today as highlighted by the screen. Once I am on the page, it gives me an idea of their overall strengths and weaknesses. I can see the Red Wings are a little better than the Devils but Devils have the slightly better offense. I can expand the page to see just the last 5 games. In this case both teams are struggling so it is a game I might want to avoid. The top of the screenshot also has tabs so i can break it down by home/road and see which players in particular are in great form. Im not beating any books by doing this but it is a useful tool in my research.", "The Merlin Bird ID app is a application that lets you ID birds based on information that you provide. This screen allows you to enter (or edit) bits of information to the app that help the app come up with suggestions for what bird you may have seen. On this screen, I have entered the geographical location where I saw the bird, what size it is, the coloring, and whether I saw it flying, in the water, at a bird feeder, etc. The app the generates a list of best possible matches based on the information I just provided. Then, I scrolled down the list and selected the actual bird that I saw. I have a lot of birds in my back yard that come to my feeder and hand around in my trees, so this app is useful for identifying what they are and keeping track of what types of birds I have seen in my yard.", "I use this app and this screen to enter daily fantasy sports contests for different NBA games. The screen changes in response to the filling of contests and the completions of different games or slates of games, and I choose the contests that I want to enter as I use the app. I also can fill out my lineups when entering the contest. I get to the screen by choosing NBA on the home screen, then hitting Classic to show my preference for the type of contests I want to enter, and then choosing a slate, which in this case is tonight's 7:00 slate. Now that I am at the screen I can scroll down and choose which contests I want to enter. If I have money in my account, then I can easily click a contest, then fill out a lineup and submit it and I will be entered. If I already have filled out a lineup, I can simply enter that one as I enter the contest.
